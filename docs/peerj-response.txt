RESPONSE SUMMARY: On the whole, we find the comments have greatly
improved the paper and thank all of the reviewers and the editor for
their time and assistance. In response to all reviewers' comments we
have reduced the emphasis of the ecological/biogeographical
results. This was done primarily because of the intractability of the
statistical separation of phylogenetic effects. As stated by all three
reviewers, we have not removed these results, as they present an
initial perspective that will be useful for readers. We have largely
followed the comments of the Reviewer 2s. 

R1

RESPONSE: Increase the clarity of bases for hypotheses about genomics
and biogeography

RESPONSE: Increase the clarity of bases for hypotheses. Connect
ecological importance of ants and genomics. 

RESPONSE: Editorial and grammatical errors have been fixed and the
entire document has been checked. Cautionary sentiment is well taken. 

R2

RESPONSE: 

- Add cautionary text on statistical power
- Reduce biogeographic/climate analysis, consider an appendix
- Change title and abstract to reduce climate/biogeography
- Tone down discussion of climate

RESPONSE: Thank you for the thorough feedback. Changes have been made
in order to reduce the conclusiveness of the findings regarding the
biogeographic patterns and implications for climate change. 

R3

RESPONSE: Although not ideal, assembly size is an estimate of genome
size. Future analysis should include a k-mer analysis. 

RESPONSE: Based on Reviewer 2 comments, the conclusiveness of the
biogeoggraphic analysis has been reduced. Added to discussion
references to the relationship between 

RESPONSE: We also considered the correct method of conducting the
analyses, such as using centers of known species ranges as suggested
by the reviewer. After considering and acutally beginning to explore
these analyses, we decided against using this approach for the main
reason that (with the exception of A. rudis) all genomes in our
sample, and most of the ant genomes present in NCBI, are from a single
location. Given the potential for selection to act to create
geographic mosaic patterns, it is most appropriate to use the data
from the sampling local. We acknowledge that this is imperfect, and in
response to this and other comments we have included more careful
language and reduced the conclusiveness of the biogeographic
patterns. Again, our intent is to add to the effort to use these
samples as a resource to broaden our view of climate change impacts. 

RESPONSE: This is a valid point. Need to add sequencing type as an
overlay. 

RESPONSE: This is an good observation, and we had initially
constructed the analysis with only the Aphaenogaster species. We
switched to this perspective, largely due to issues of power (as has
been pointed out by other reviewers). With regard to phylogeny, yes
such patterns could result from phylogeny, and undoubtedly this is
playing a role; however, without more sampling we do not currently,
even when including all sequenced ant genomes, have enough power to
distinguish the impacts. Our preference is to not attempt to include
too many statistical factors and have addressed this issue by reducing
the conclusiveness of the biogeographic patterns.

RESPONSE: Whole colony DNA was used in order to have sufficient
concentrations for sequencing. The method used was explicitely
developed for whole colony sequencing of a similarly colonial
mosquito, and in disucussion with the sequencing facility, polygyny
was not an issue for any part of the sequencing process. The more
pressing issue for assembly was contamination from non-target
organisms, this was addressed with sequence cleaning procedure. We did
not examine colony structure yet, but are certainly considering this
for future work.

RESPONSE: This is a great suggestion. We are exploring this option for
the next stages of analysis.

RESPONSE: Average genome size?

RESPONSE: Line 128-130: Why was this BLAST analysis done?

RESPONSE: Thank you, we certainly hope so. 


Reviewer 1 (Anonymous)
Basic reporting

The article is generally well prepared, though see comments below
regarding climate variables and the abbreviations. Figure are
generally crisp / easy to read (save vectors in Figure 6).

A few areas that require attention include:

(1) I think the manuscript could be improved through the addition of
more background / context regarding the relationship(s) between
climate adaptation, genome size, and response to climatic change.

Given the exploratory nature of the study, perhaps it is not possible
to develop predictions / testable hypotheses, but it was unclear to me
how / why relationships between genome size and climate gradients
would be indicative of ant responses to climate change. In think this
is especially important given that the authors were apparently not
able to control for phylogenetic relatedness (which they acknowledge
and discuss).

The title makes a link between 'ecological genomics' and 'responses to
climate change', but that's not really what this paper is
doing. Instead, the study involves correlating aspects of the genome
with climate variables, finding some significant relationships, and
then claiming that these relationships are somehow informative (or at
least warrant consideration) of climate change responses. However,
without a clear, mechanistic linkage between climate, genome size, and
climate adaptation, I could not follow how these biogeographical
relationships say anything about climate change responses.

I think it is enough to report these relationships and speculate some
in the Discussion as the what they might mean, but as written, I do
not feel the title reflects the study or its findings.

RESPONSE: Increase the clarity of bases for hypotheses about genomics
and biogeography


(2) At times the writing was vague and wandering, particularly in the
Introduction. A good example is L69-70, which states "...phylogenetics
is a factor determining the response of ant species to climatic
change...". It was unclear to this reader how / why "phylogenetics"
would "determine" a response to climatic change.

The Introduction also reads a bit like a laundry list of reasons
justifying what it is important to sequences the genomes of ants and
Aphaenogaster in particular. In my opinion, a lot of this wasted
space. I think it is enough to say ants are important generally,
Aphaenogaster is something the authors have studied and so have some
insights and get on with a discussion about genomics and climate
adaptation - either broadly or in ants specifically to the extent that
is possible.

RESPONSE: Increase the clarity of bases for hypotheses. Connect
ecological importance of ants and genomics. 

(3) A few minor points: 

L168-170 - Check grammar / missing word.

Figure 1 - Not sure this one is necessary.

Figure 6 (vectors and associated labels need to be much darker to be visible). 

There is some minor confusion regarding which climate variables / datasets were used when. For example-

Table 2 - PRISM data are reported here, but worldclim is used in the analyses - any reason for different datasets? 

L178 - Annual minimum temperature and annual maximum temperature are
not among the 19 standard bioclim variables from WordClim - are these
custom or referring to BIO5/6 (which are month not annual)?

Experimental design

As mentioned above, I think the manuscript would benefit if
predictions or research questions were more clearly articulated and
supported in the Introduction. While two hypotheses are mentioned in
the final paragraph of the Introduction, they tended to be vague or
poorly worded.

For example: "...to test the hypothesis that climate variables shape
the distribution of ant genomes, we explored the correlation between
spatial and multi-decadal climate variables". First, what is the
distribution of an ant genome? And second, it reads as if the
correlation of interest is between "spatial and multi-decadal climate
variables" - in other words, between two kinds of climate variables,
not between a set of climate variables and some aspect of ant genomes.

Otherwise, the methods are well described and the statistical analyses
seem well executed.

Validity of the findings

I will echo my comments above regarding the failure to clearly
articulate the linkages between climate gradients, genome attributes
(size, similarity), and responses to climate change.

While the data seem robust (I cannot comment on the sequencing /
bioinformatics) and the analyses sound, and while the authors
acknowledge the importance of other factors ignored (for now) in the
analyses (such as phylogenetic correlations), I do feel that, given
the sample size, the data and results are somewhat limited in what
they can tell use about climate adaptation / responses in this group
of ants. It certainly is great to have and report these new sequences,
which will add to a growing body of sequence data for ants, I just
caution against over-interpretation / speculation given the small
sample size and uncertainty.

RESPONSE: Editorial and grammatical errors have been fixed and the
entire document has been checked. Cautionary sentiment is well taken.

Comments for the Author

Title: Expanded view of the ecological genomics of ant responses to climate change

The authors have produced draft sequences for the genomes of six
species of ants in the genus Aphaenogaster collected from eastern
North America. There is high value in these ant genome sequences: ants
in this genus are models for studies of ecology and behavior (>300
papers with Aphaenogaster in the title), no sequence from this genus
had to date been reported, these six new genomes increase the number
of ants with sequenced genomes by ~25%.

The methods for genome sequencing and analysis are sound and the
writing style and quality are appropriate (see minor issues
below). The new ant genome sequences could represent a publication on
their own, even without much analysis. The authors perform superficial
comparisons of the genome sequences: showing higher similarities
between genomes of species in the same genus than between genuses, as
well distinct separation from genera compared with others previously
published ant genomes in the formicoid subfamily. Intriguingly, the
data also support the polyphyly of A. rudis as described in recent
literature, though this evidence is based on a sample size of
n=2. Together, these data would be sufficient for publicaiton in
peerj.

However, the manuscript is framed within the context of using ants as
indicator taxa for environmental disturbance and climatic
variation. Specifically, the authors suggest that ecological variables
should influence ant genomic signatures. They propose that (i) ants
found within similar ecological conditions should have more similar
genomes; and that (ii) genome size should similarly correspond to
biogeographic patterns. These hypotheses are original and would be
very interesting if proven (stronger datasets to test such hypotheses
may exist in mammals). Unfortunately, neither hypothesis is very well
substantiated and the supporting data is rather tenuous because the
authors (i) lack power (a small number of species for a relatively
high number of examined environmental variables) and (ii) do not
control for phylogeny. We note that additionally there is little
consideration of possible variation within species.


Furthermore, the title evokes responses to climate change - which
implicitly suggests temperature manipulation experiments - but this is
quite far from the paper.

This is somewhat frustrating given that the senior author has a strong
track record of rigorous work. Controlling for phylogeny/ would make
the climatic/biogeographical analysis much stronger, although we note
that 21 of the 25 ant species used come from the Americas thus
potentially creating a bias. A rigorous analysis of the proposed
hypotheses would likely require much additional data generation that
is likely beyond the scope of this paper.

We recommend that the authors: 

- Move the biogeographic/climatic analysis from results to
  discussion. And shorten it substantially in the main text (this
  could involve moving some aspects to supplementary).

- Make it clear that the manuscript mainly reports a powerful new
  phylogenomic resource for an important ant genus

- Change the title and abstract (and other parts) of the manuscript to
  focus on the resource and dramatically tone down interpretations
  linked to ecology or effects of climate change.

RESPONSE: 

- Add cautionary text on statistical power
- Reduce biogeographic/climate analysis, consider an appendix
- Change title and abstract to reduce climate/biogeography
- Tone down discussion of climate

We expect that this would only represent a small amount of work. 

With kind regards,

Gino Brignoli & Yannick Wurm

        used as biological measures of genome completeness.
? L126: what does "70% of fragments mapped " mean? Fragments of what? Mapped from where to where?
? Ref "The evolution of genome size in ants. " - should only have 4
      authors but has about 20x more!
? The two rudis colonies do not cluster together according to
   whole-genome MASH. I understand the authors dont want to do
   fullgenome comparisons here - however does e.g., a mitochondrial or
   nuclear “housekeeping” gene phylogeny based on sequences from these
   sample support the polyphyly?

Experimental design

Major comments:

There are a few issues with the main analysis correlating
environmental variables with genomic characteristics:

1. The total length of assemblies is not a good metric for genome
size. While flow cytometry is ideal, k-mer analysis (e.g. GenomeScope)
also tends to be more accurate than assembly size so should be used
instead.

RESPONSE: Although not ideal, assembly size is an estimate of genome
size. Future analysis should include a k-mer analysis. 

2. The authors note that they did not perform phylogenetic correction
for their analyses (line 237) but seem to acknowledge that it would be
a more appropriate approach. I would argue that such a correction is
essential. The conclusion that climate influences genomic
characteristics is completely dependent on this analysis.


RESPONSE: Based on Reviewer 2 comments, the conclusiveness of the
biogeoggraphic analysis has been reduced. Added to discussion
references to the relationship between 

3. It appears that the latitude and longitude of collecting site were
used for correlational analyses. However, given that this study is
comparative in nature, each individual genome is meant to represent an
entire species. And several of these species have very large ranges
that span the entire eastern United States into Canada making these
data points inappropriate for this analysis. The midpoint of the
species ranges could be a reasonable alternative. Unless the authors
are arguing that these six specimens that they have used are
effectively a single population but I don’t believe that this is the
case. While there appears to be some undiscovered species diversity
within A. rudis, the rest appear to be good species without gene flow
between them.

RESPONSE: We also considered the correct method of conducting the
analyses, such as using centers of known species ranges as suggested
by the reviewer. After considering and acutally beginning to explore
these analyses, we decided against using this approach for the main
reason that (with the exception of A. rudis) all genomes in our
sample, and most of the ant genomes present in NCBI, are from a single
location. Given the potential for selection to act to create
geographic mosaic patterns, it is most appropriate to use the data
from the sampling local. We acknowledge that this is imperfect, and in
response to this and other comments we have included more careful
language and reduced the conclusiveness of the biogeographic
patterns. Again, our intent is to add to the effort to use these
samples as a resource to broaden our view of climate change impacts. 

4. The previously sequenced ant genomes included in the analysis were
sequenced using a variety of different methods. For example, some
genomes included 454 sequencing. This could bias the size of the
genome assembled. Perhaps some of these influences could be taken into
account.

RESPONSE: This is a valid point. We have included text pointing this
out as a potential confoudning variable that should be controlled for
in future studies. 

5. The authors perform their analyses both by including Aphaenogaster
genomes and again without these new genomes. However, a third analysis
that focuses just on Aphaenogaster might be more compelling. This
would eliminate some of the phylogenetic bias in the data and also
eliminates many of the other factors that could be playing a role as
all Aphaenogaster genomes were collected and assembled in the same
way. I also wonder if leaving out the fungus-growing ants, a group
that is also over-represented, could have a similar effect. Relatedly,
the fact that Aphaenogaster has such an impact on the analyses seems
to suggest that phylogeny is playing a significant role.

RESPONSE: This is an good observation, and we had initially
constructed the analysis with only the Aphaenogaster species. We
switched to this perspective, largely due to issues of power (as has
been pointed out by other reviewers). With regard to phylogeny, yes
such patterns could result from phylogeny, and undoubtedly this is
playing a role; however, without more sampling we do not currently,
even when including all sequenced ant genomes, have enough power to
distinguish the impacts. Our preference is to not attempt to include
too many statistical factors and have addressed this issue by reducing
the conclusiveness of the biogeographic patterns.

Other comments:

- More detail is needed for the DNA extraction procedure. Was it
  really necessary to collect DNA from a whole colony? Is there
  polygyny or multiple-mating in these species that could affect the
  assembly? Reporting heterozygosity/genetic diversity would be useful
  and these data could be used to infer colony structure if it is not
  already known.

RESPONSE: Whole colonoies were used in order to have sufficient
concentrations of DNA for sequencing. The method used was explicitely
developed for whole colony sequencing of a colonial mosquito species.
The sequenced ants are known to for high rates of polygyny. The more
pressing issue for assembly was contamination from non-target
organisms, this was addressed with sequence cleaning procedure. We did
not examine colony structure yet, but are certainly considering this
for future work.

- While genome annotation is certainly a significant additional
  challenge, comparing gene sets across species could provide
  additional insight. This can now be relatively easily accomplished
  with pipelines like BRAKER which don’t necessarily require
  transcript data to run.

RESPONSE: This is a great suggestion. We are exploring this option for
the next stages of analysis as we would like to make these sequences
available to the general public. 

- Line 128: That is not the average genome size of those listed in the
  table

RESPONSE: Yes, this was a typo. Fixed now in both the abstract and the
main text. 

- Line 128-130: Why was this BLAST analysis done?

RESPONSE: The BLAST analysis was used primarily to identify
contaminant sequences, but it was also used to match contigs to
other sequences in NCBI's sequence database.

Comments for the Author

This study by Lau and colleagues presents the newly sequenced genomes
of six species of ants in the genus Aphaenogaster. Given their
worldwide abundance and ecological importance, the genomes of these
species are likely to be of substantial scientific use. There are
relatively few taxonomic groups, particularly within ants, where
multiple closely related species have been de novo sequenced, making
this a potentially valuable resource for studying both ants and genome
evolution.

RESPONSE: Thank you, we certainly hope so.
